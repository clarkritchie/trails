# trails.losritchi.es

This is a tiny and very simple React app for me and myself only.  I use it to formulate my mountain bike ride names (for Strava) using the actual trail names in the Bend area in the form that I want, for example:  Ben's > VooDoo > Phil's

See [trails.losritchi.es](http://trails.losritchi.es).
